# 📞 Call Center Analysis

🌟 Why This Project Matters

In customer-facing industries, call centers are the heartbeat of customer experience but they often struggle with long wait times, inconsistent agent performance, and high customer churn.

This project demonstrates how I applied data analytics to:
* Identify peak call times and optimize workforce allocation.
* Evaluate agent performance and uncover training opportunities.
* Detect resolution bottlenecks linked to longer call durations.
* Translate raw data into strategic recommendations that improve service delivery and customer satisfaction.

👉 In short: I turned messy call data into clear business insights that drive efficiency and better customer experiences.

## 📊 Key Insights (Business-Focused)

* ⏱ Call Volume Trends: Peak times were late mornings & evenings → informed smarter shift scheduling.
* 🎯 Agent Workload: A few agents carried disproportionate call loads → revealed staffing imbalance.
* ✅ Resolution Rates: Longer calls correlated with unresolved cases → suggested targeted training.
* 📉 Efficiency Gains: Optimized staffing & training could reduce wait times by 15–20%.
